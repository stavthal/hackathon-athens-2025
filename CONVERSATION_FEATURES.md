# Advanced Conversation Features with AWS SDK

## What's Been Implemented

Your AI agent now has **context and memory** within a conversation session! Here's what's working:

### âœ… Conversation Memory

- The agent remembers everything you've said in the current session
- It can reference previous messages and maintain context
- Conversations are automatically saved to browser localStorage
- Messages are limited to the last 20 exchanges to manage token limits

### âœ… Features Added

1. **Backend (`/api/chat/route.js`)**:

   - Accepts `conversationHistory` array along with new messages
   - Validates message format for safety
   - Sends full conversation context to Claude
   - Limits history to prevent token overflow
   - Added system prompt for better contextual responses

2. **Frontend (`ChatBox.jsx`)**:
   - Sends conversation history with each request
   - Persists conversations in localStorage
   - Added "Clear Chat" button to reset conversations
   - Improved UI with conversation header

## Test the Memory

Try these conversation examples:

1. **Basic Memory Test**:

   ```
   User: "My name is John and I love pizza"
   Assistant: "Nice to meet you, John! Pizza is delicious..."

   User: "What's my name and what do I love?"
   Assistant: "Your name is John and you love pizza!"
   ```

2. **Context Building**:
   ```
   User: "I'm working on a React project"
   User: "Can you help me with useState?"
   Assistant: [Will provide React-specific useState help, knowing it's for your project]
   ```

## Advanced AWS SDK Features (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. **Multiple Conversation Sessions**

```javascript
// Add session management with DynamoDB
import {
  DynamoDBClient,
  PutItemCommand,
  GetItemCommand,
} from "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb";

const dynamodb = new DynamoDBClient({
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION,
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
    secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  },
});

// Save conversation to DynamoDB
async function saveConversation(sessionId, messages) {
  const command = new PutItemCommand({
    TableName: "ChatSessions",
    Item: {
      sessionId: { S: sessionId },
      messages: { S: JSON.stringify(messages) },
      timestamp: { N: Date.now().toString() },
    },
  });
  await dynamodb.send(command);
}
```

### 2. **Conversation Analytics with CloudWatch**

```javascript
import {
  CloudWatchClient,
  PutMetricDataCommand,
} from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch";

const cloudwatch = new CloudWatchClient({ region: process.env.AWS_REGION });

// Track conversation metrics
async function trackConversationMetrics(messageCount, responseTime) {
  const command = new PutMetricDataCommand({
    Namespace: "ChatBot/Conversations",
    MetricData: [
      {
        MetricName: "MessageCount",
        Value: messageCount,
        Unit: "Count",
      },
      {
        MetricName: "ResponseTime",
        Value: responseTime,
        Unit: "Milliseconds",
      },
    ],
  });
  await cloudwatch.send(command);
}
```

### 3. **Smart Context Summarization**

```javascript
// When conversation gets too long, summarize older messages
async function summarizeConversation(messages) {
  const oldMessages = messages.slice(0, -10); // Older messages
  const recentMessages = messages.slice(-10); // Keep recent 10

  // Use Claude to summarize the older conversation
  const summaryPrompt = `Please summarize this conversation concisely: ${JSON.stringify(
    oldMessages
  )}`;

  // Get summary from Claude and prepend to recent messages
  return [
    { role: "system", content: `Previous conversation summary: ${summary}` },
    ...recentMessages,
  ];
}
```

### 4. **Multi-Model Support**

```javascript
// Switch between different models based on conversation needs
function selectModel(conversationContext) {
  const hasCodeQuestions = conversationContext.some(
    (msg) => msg.content.includes("code") || msg.content.includes("programming")
  );

  if (hasCodeQuestions) {
    return "anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0"; // Better for coding
  } else {
    return "anthropic.claude-3-5-haiku-20241022-v1:0"; // Faster for general chat
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Test Conversation Memory:

1. Ask: "Remember that I like chocolate ice cream"
2. Then ask: "What's my favorite ice cream flavor?"
3. The agent should remember and respond correctly!

### Test Context Building:

1. Say: "I'm building a Next.js app with TypeScript"
2. Ask: "How do I add a new page?"
3. The agent will give Next.js-specific advice, knowing your tech stack!

## Configuration

Make sure your `.env.local` file has:

```env
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
```

## How It Works

1. **Frontend**: Maintains `messages` state and sends full conversation history
2. **Backend**: Receives history, validates it, and sends to Claude with context
3. **Claude**: Gets full conversation context and can reference previous messages
4. **Persistence**: Conversations saved to localStorage for session persistence

Your agent now has memory and can maintain context throughout the conversation! ðŸŽ‰
